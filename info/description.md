With linear and slice scans complete, we are now ready to check the crystals with a 3D scanner. For this, we'll
start with a cubic sample of the crystal and check the adjacent atoms, much like in the previous scans. This crystal
type contains two atoms composing the elements "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms
should alternate down each of the three axis.

You are given a sample crystal as a 3D array of atoms. Well formed crystals will have atoms alternating along the X,
Y and Z axis (height, width, depth). If any atoms are found next to the same type of atom, then this crystal is
unusable.

In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible.
The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
