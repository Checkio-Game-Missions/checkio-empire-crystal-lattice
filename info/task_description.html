        In a great number of the cosmogonic myths the world is said to have developed from a great water, which was the
        prime matter. In many cases, as for instance in an Indian myth, this prime matter is indicated as a solution,
        out of which the solid earth crystallized out.

    And we ready to check crystals in all directions.
    Let's take cubic crystal sample and check this.
    Our crystal contains two atoms - "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium).
    These atoms should alternate each other in all three dimensions.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a random sample from crystal lattice as 3D array of letters.

    The good crystal should have the periodic arrangement (one by one) in rows, columns and depth lines.
    If any atoms are repeated in these lines, then this crystal is broken.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Atom cube as a list of lists of list of strings.

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is a crystal good or not as a boolean.

    This mission can show you work with more deep structures, which can not be easily drawn in notebook.
